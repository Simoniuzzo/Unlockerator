# Unlockerator

Unlockerator is a tool that allows you to unlock DLCs for games on Steam, on both Windows and Linux(Proton/Native).

## Features

- Installation and uninstallation of DLC "unlocks"
- ~Compatibility only with the non-Flatpack/Snap version of Steam (original version)~
- ~Support only for games that use Proton (not native Linux games), but support for native Linux games will be added in the future!~

## Usage

To use Unlockerator, download the latest version from the [GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/Simoniuzzo/Unlockerator/releases), and simply run it!

- ### Linux 
  - For manual path(native games) > `./Unlockerator_Linux --manual "path/to/steam/steamapps/directory/"`
  - For manual path(proton games) > `./Unlockerator_Linux --manual "path/to/steam/common/directory/"`
  - This will be fixed in the next patch :)

- ### Windows 
  - Just follow the instructions on screen!

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the creators of the [@acidicoala/SmokeAPI](https://github.com/acidicoala/SmokeAPI) project for their DLLs that I have used in my program.

## TODO List

- Optimize the code
- GUI?
- Implement other features in the future
