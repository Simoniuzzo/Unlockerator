# Unlockerator

Unlockerator is a tool that allows you to unlock DLCs for games on Steam, on both Windows and Linux.

## Features

- Installation and uninstallation of DLC "unlocks"
- Compatibility only with the non-Flatpack/Snap version of Steam (original version)
- Support only for games that use Proton (not native Linux games), but support for native Linux games will be added in the future!

## Usage

To use Unlockerator, download the latest version from the [GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/Simoniuzzo/Unlockerator/releases), and simply run it!

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the creators of the [@acidicoala/SmokeAPI](https://github.com/acidicoala/SmokeAPI) project for their DLLs that I have used in my program.

## Todo List

- Add support for the Windows version
- Add support for native Linux games
- Add support for game installations in the non-default directory 
- Implement other features in the future
